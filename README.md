# Minecraft Datapack AI

If there is one thing I love, it's AI's

idk why...

The thing is, it's very hard to make an AI with just a Minecraft Datapack, so most people just use existing entities.
But I want to make an AI *using completly custom code and no existing mobs*

why did I do this to myself... :(

## Current AI's
- Basic AI
> Walks around and stuff
> 
> Has Gravity and can jump up blocks
> 
- World Miner
> Suggested by one of my friends
> 
> Basically warps around your world and mines it all out
> 
> Not really an AI, but whatever
- Crossbow Turret
> My second favorite AI (my favorite is the basic AI)
> 
> Aims at hostile mobs (not all are added yet)
> 
> Shoots them with arrows
> 
> yeah...
