# Minecraft Datapack AI

If there is one thing I love, it's AI's

idk why...

The thing is, it's very hard to make an AI with just a Minecraft Datapack, so most people just use existing entities.
But I want to make an AI *using completly custom code and no existing mobs*

why did I do this to myself... :(
